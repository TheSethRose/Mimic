Supabase is open source. We choose open source tools which are scalable and make them simple to use.

Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. While we are building many of the features that Firebase offers, we are not going about it the same way: our technological choices are quite different; everything we use is open source; and wherever possible, we use and support existing tools rather than developing from scratch.

Most notably, we use Postgres rather than a NoSQL store. This choice was deliberate. We believe that no other database offers the functionality required to compete with Firebase, while maintaining the scalability required to go beyond it.

Our goal at Supabase is to make all of Postgres easy to use. That doesn’t mean you have to use all of it. If you’re a Postgres veteran, you’ll probably love the tools that we offer. If you’ve never used Postgres before, then start smaller and grow into it. If you just want to treat Postgres like a simple table-store, that’s perfectly fine.

Each Supabase project consists of several tools:

Postgres is the core of Supabase. We do not abstract the Postgres database—you can access it and use it with full privileges. We provide tools which make Postgres as easy to use as Firebase.

An open source Dashboard for managing your database and services.

A JWT-based API for managing users and issuing access tokens. This integrates with PostgreSQL's Row Level Security and the API servers.

A standalone web server that turns your Postgres database directly into a RESTful API. We use this with our pg_graphql extension to provide a GraphQL API.

A scalable WebSocket engine for managing user Presence, broadcasting messages, and streaming database changes.

An S3-compatible object storage service that stores metadata in Postgres.

A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

A RESTful API for managing your Postgres. Fetch tables, add roles, and run queries.

A cloud-native, multi-tenant Postgres connection pooler.

Build a Product Management Android App with Jetpack Compose

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic product management app. The app demonstrates management operations, photo upload, account creation and authentication using:

If you get stuck while working through this guide, refer to the full example on GitHub.

Before we start building we're going to set up our Database and API. This is as simple as starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

Now we are going to set up the database schema. You can just copy/paste the SQL from below and run it yourself.

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key. Get the URL from the API settings section of a project and the key from the the API Keys section of a project's Settings page.

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can read the full announcement, but in the transition period, you can use both the current anon and service_role keys and the new publishable key with the form sb_publishable_xxx which will replace the older keys.

To get the key values, open the API Keys section of a project's Settings page and do the following:

From the Google Console, create a new project and add OAuth2 credentials.

In your Supabase Auth settings enable Google as a provider and set the required credentials as outlined in the auth docs.

Open Android Studio > New Project > Base Activity (Jetpack Compose).

Create or edit the local.properties file at the root (same level as build.gradle) of your project.

Note: Do not commit this file to your source control, for example, by adding it to your .gitignore file!

In your build.gradle (app) file, create a Properties object and read the values from your local.properties file by calling the buildConfigField method:

Read the value from BuildConfig:

If you get stuck while working through this guide, refer to the full example on GitHub.

Before you start building you need to set up the Database and API. You can do this by starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

Now set up the database schema. You can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can copy/paste the SQL from below and run it.

You can pull the database schema down to your local project by running the db pull command. Read the local development docs for detailed instructions.

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key. Get the URL from the API settings section of a project and the key from the the API Keys section of a project's Settings page.

To get the key values, open the API Keys section of a project's Settings page and do the following:

Start with building the Angular app from scratch.

You can use the Angular CLI to initialize an app called supabase-angular. The command sets some defaults, that you change to suit your needs:

Then, install the only additional dependency: supabase-js

Build a User Management App with RedwoodJS

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic user management app. The app authenticates and identifies the user, stores their profile information in the database, and allows the user to log in, update their profile details, and upload a profile photo. The app uses:

If you get stuck while working through this guide, refer to the full example on GitHub.

A Redwood application is split into two parts: a frontend and a backend. This is represented as two node projects within a single monorepo.

The frontend project is called web and the backend project is called api. For clarity, we will refer to these in prose as "sides," that is, the web side and the api side. They are separate projects because code on the web side will end up running in the user's browser while code on the api side will run on a server somewhere.

Important: When this guide refers to "API," that means the Supabase API and when it refers to api side, that means the RedwoodJS api side.

The api side is an implementation of a GraphQL API. The business logic is organized into "services" that represent their own internal API and can be called both from external GraphQL requests and other internal services.

The web side is built with React. Redwood's router makes it simple to map URL paths to React "Page" components (and automatically code-split your app on each route). Pages may contain a "Layout" component to wrap content. They also contain "Cells" and regular React components. Cells allow you to declaratively manage the lifecycle of a component that fetches and displays data.

For the sake of consistency with the other framework tutorials, we'll build this app a little differently than normal. We won't use Prisma to connect to the Supabase Postgres database or Prisma migrations as one typically might in a Redwood app. Instead, we'll rely on the Supabase client to do some of the work on the web side and use the client again on the api side to do data fetch

Before you start building you need to set up the Database and API. You can do this by starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

Now set up the database schema. You can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can copy/paste the SQL from below and run it.

You can pull the database schema down to your local project by running the db pull command. Read the local development docs for detailed instructions.

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key. Get the URL from the API settings section of a project and the key from the the API Keys section of a project's Settings page.

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can read the full announcement, but in the transition period, you can use both the current anon and service_role keys and the new publishable key with the form sb_publishable_xxx which will replace the older keys.

To get the key values, open the API Keys section of a project's Settings page and do the following:

Let's start building the Vue 3 app from scratch.

We can quickly use Vite with Vue 3 Template to initialize an app called supabase-vue-3:

Then let's install the only additional dependency: supabase-js

And finally we want to save the environment variables in a .env. All we need are the API URL and the key that you copied earlier.

With the API credentials in place, create an src/supabase.js helper file to initializ

Build a User Management App with refine

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic user management app. The app authenticates and identifies the user, stores their profile information in the database, and allows the user to log in, update their profile details, and upload a profile photo. The app uses:

If you get stuck while working through this guide, refer to the full example on GitHub.

refine is a React-based framework used to rapidly build data-heavy applications like admin panels, dashboards, storefronts and any type of CRUD apps. It separates app concerns into individual layers, each backed by a React context and respective provider object. For example, the auth layer represents a context served by a specific set of authProvider methods that carry out authentication and authorization actions such as logging in, logging out, getting roles data, etc. Similarly, the data layer offers another level of abstraction that is equipped with dataProvider methods to handle CRUD operations at appropriate backend API endpoints.

refine provides hassle-free integration with Supabase backend with its supplementary @refinedev/supabase package. It generates authProvider and dataProvider methods at project initialization, so we don't need to expend much effort to define them ourselves. We just need to choose Supabase as our backend service while creating the app with create refine-app.

It is possible to customize the authProvider for Supabase and as we'll see below, it can be tweaked from src/authProvider.ts file. In contrast, the Supabase dataProvider is part of node_modules and therefore is not subject to modification.

Before you start building you need to set up the Database and API. You can do this by starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

Now set up the database schema. You can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can copy/paste the SQL from below and run it.

Generate text embeddings using Edge Functions.

This guide will walk you through how to generate high quality text embeddings in Edge Functions using its built-in AI inference API, so no external API is required.

Let's build an Edge Function that will accept an input string and generate an embedding for it. Edge Functions are server-side TypeScript HTTP endpoints that run on-demand closest to your users.

Make sure you have the latest version of the Supabase CLI installed.

Initialize Supabase in the root directory of your app and start your local stack.

Create an Edge Function that we will use to generate embeddings. We'll call this embed (you can name this anything you like).

This will create a new TypeScript file called index.ts under ./supabase/functions/embed.

Let's create a new inference session to be used in the lifetime of this function. Multiple requests can use the same inference session.

Currently, only the gte-small (https://huggingface.co/Supabase/gte-small) text embedding model is supported in Supabase's Edge Runtime.

Modify our request handler to accept an input string from the POST request JSON body.

Then generate the embedding by calling session.run(input).

Note the two options we pass to session.run():

To test the Edge Function, first start a local functions server.

Then in a new shell, create an HTTP request using cURL and pass in your input in the JSON body.

Be sure to replace ANON_KEY with your project's anonymous key. You can get this key by running supabase status.

      - First time running Supabase services?
- Step 4: Send a test request#

Getting Started with Edge Functions

Learn how to create, test, and deploy your first Edge Function using the Supabase CLI.

Before getting started, make sure you have the Supabase CLI installed. Check out the CLI installation guide for installation methods and troubleshooting.

You can also create and deploy functions directly from the Supabase Dashboard. Check out our Dashboard Quickstart guide.

If you don't have a project yet, initialize a new Supabase project in your current directory.

Or, if you already have a project locally, navigate to your project directory. If your project hasn't been configured for Supabase yet, make sure to run the supabase init command.

After this step, you should have a project directory with a supabase folder containing config.toml and an empty functions directory.

Within your project, generate a new Edge Function with a basic template:

This creates a new function at supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts with this starter code:

This function accepts a JSON payload with a name field and returns a greeting message.

After this step, you should have a new file at supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts containing the starter Edge Function code.

Start the local development server to test your function:

The supabase start command downloads Docker images, which can take a few minutes initially.

Function not starting locally?

Your function is now running at http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/hello-world. Hot reloading is enabled, which means that the server will automatically reload when you save changes to your function code.

After this step, you should have all Supabase services running locally, and your Edge Function serving at the local URL. Keep these terminal windows open.

Open a new terminal and test your function with curl:

Need your SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY?

Run supabase status to see your local anon key and other credentials.

After running this curl command, you should see:

You can also try different inputs. Chan

Learn how to use Supabase Queues to add and read messages

This guide is an introduction to interacting with Supabase Queues via the Dashboard and official client library. Check out Queues API Reference for more details on our API.

Supabase Queues is a pull-based Message Queue consisting of three main components: Queues, Messages, and Queue Types.

A pull-based Queue is a Message storage and delivery system where consumers actively fetch Messages when they're ready to process them - similar to constantly refreshing a webpage to display the latest updates. Our pull-based Queues process Messages in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner without priority levels.

A Message in a Queue is a JSON object that is stored until a consumer explicitly processes and removes it, like a task waiting in a to-do list until someone checks and completes it.

Supabase Queues offers three types of Queues:

Basic Queue: A durable Queue that stores Messages in a logged table.

Unlogged Queue: A transient Queue that stores Messages in an unlogged table for better performance but may result in loss of Queue Messages.

Partitioned Queue (Coming Soon): A durable and scalable Queue that stores Messages in multiple table partitions for better performance.

To get started, navigate to the Supabase Queues Postgres Module under Integrations in the Dashboard and enable the pgmq extension.

pgmq extension is available in Postgres version 15.6.1.143 or later.

If you've already created a Queue click the Create a queue button instead.

Queue names can only be lowercase and hyphens and underscores are permitted.

Every new Queue creates two tables in the pgmq schema. These tables are pgmq.q_<queue_name> to store and process active messages and pgmq.a_<queue_name> to store any archived messages.

A "Basic Queue" will create pgmq.q_<queue_name> and pgmq.a_<queue_name> tables as logged tables.

However, an "Unlogged Queue" will create pgmq.q_<queue_name> as an unlogged table for better performance while sacr

Develop locally, deploy to the Supabase Platform, and set up CI/CD workflows

The Supabase CLI enables you to run the entire Supabase stack locally, on your machine or in a CI environment. With just two commands, you can set up and start a new local project:

Run the CLI by prefixing each command with npx or bunx:

You can also install the CLI as dev dependency via npm:

When a new version is released, you can update the CLI using the same methods.

If you have installed the CLI as dev dependency via npm, you can update it with:

If you have any Supabase containers running locally, stop them and delete their data volumes before proceeding with the upgrade. This ensures that Supabase managed services can apply new migrations on a clean state of the local database.

Remember to save any local schema and data changes before stopping because the --no-backup flag will delete them.

The Supabase CLI uses Docker containers to manage the local development stack. Follow the official guide to install and configure Docker Desktop:

Alternately, you can use a different container tool that offers Docker compatible APIs.

Inside the folder where you want to create your project, run:

This will create a new supabase folder. It's safe to commit this folder to your version control system.

Now, to start the Supabase stack, run:

This takes time on your first run because the CLI needs to download the Docker images to your local machine. The CLI includes the entire Supabase toolset, and a few additional images that are useful for local development (like a local SMTP server and a database diff tool).

Once all of the Supabase services are running, you'll see output containing your local Supabase credentials. It should look like this, with urls and keys that you'll use in your local project:

The local development environment includes Supabase Studio, a graphical interface for working with your database.

When you are finished working on your Supabase project, you can stop the stack (wi

Use Supabase with Android Kotlin

Learn how to create a Supabase project, add some sample data to your database, and query the data from an Android Kotlin app.

Go to database.new and create a new Supabase project.

Alternatively, you can create a project using the Management API:

When your project is up and running, go to the Table Editor, create a new table and insert some data.

Alternatively, you can run the following snippet in your project's SQL Editor. This will create a instruments table with some sample data.

Make the data in your table publicly readable by adding an RLS policy:

Open Android Studio > New > New Android Project.

Open build.gradle.kts (app) file and add the serialization plug, Ktor client, and Supabase client.

Replace the version placeholders $kotlin_version with the Kotlin version of the project, and $supabase_version and $ktor_version with the respective latest versions.

The latest supabase-kt version can be found here and Ktor version can be found here.

Add the following line to the AndroidManifest.xml file under the manifest tag and outside the application tag.

You can create a Supabase client whenever you need to perform an API call.

For the sake of simplicity, we will create a client in the MainActivity.kt file at the top just below the imports.

Replace the supabaseUrl and supabaseKey with your own:

Create a serializable data class to represent the data from the database.

Add the following below the createSupabaseClient function in the MainActivity.kt file.

Use LaunchedEffect to fetch data from the database and display it in a LazyColumn.

Replace the default MainActivity class with the following code.

Note that we are making a network request from our UI code. In production, you should probably use a ViewModel to separate the UI and data fetching logic.

Run the app on an emulator or a physical device by clicking the Run app button in Android Studio.

Learn how to create a Supabase project, add some sample data to your database, and query the data from a Flutter app.

Go to database.new and create a new Supabase project.

Alternatively, you can create a project using the Management API:

When your project is up and running, go to the Table Editor, create a new table and insert some data.

Alternatively, you can run the following snippet in your project's SQL Editor. This will create a instruments table with some sample data.

Make the data in your table publicly readable by adding an RLS policy:

Create a Flutter app using the flutter create command. You can skip this step if you already have a working app.

The fastest way to get started is to use the supabase_flutter client library which provides a convenient interface for working with Supabase from a Flutter app.

Open the pubspec.yaml file inside your Flutter app and add supabase_flutter as a dependency.

Open lib/main.dart and edit the main function to initialize Supabase using your project URL and public API (anon) key:

Use a FutureBuilder to fetch the data when the home page loads and display the query result in a ListView.

Replace the default MyApp and MyHomePage classes with the following code.

Run your app on a platform of your choosing! By default an app should launch in your web browser.

Note that supabase_flutter is compatible with web, iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows apps. Running the app on macOS requires additional configuration to set the entitlements.

Many sign in methods require deep links to redirect the user back to your app after authentication. Read more about setting deep links up for all platforms (including web) in the Flutter Mobile Guide.

In production, your Android app needs explicit permission to use the internet connection on the user's device which is required to communicate with Supabase APIs. To do this, add the following line to the android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file.

Use Supabase with React

Learn how to create a Supabase project, add some sample data to your database, and query the data from a React app.

Go to database.new and create a new Supabase project.

Alternatively, you can create a project using the Management API:

When your project is up and running, go to the Table Editor, create a new table and insert some data.

Alternatively, you can run the following snippet in your project's SQL Editor. This will create a instruments table with some sample data.

Make the data in your table publicly readable by adding an RLS policy:

Create a React app using a Vite template.

The fastest way to get started is to use the supabase-js client library which provides a convenient interface for working with Supabase from a React app.

Navigate to the React app and install supabase-js.

Create a .env.local file and populate with your Supabase connection variables:

Replace the contents of App.jsx to add a getInstruments function to fetch the data and display the query result to the page using a Supabase client.

Run the development server, go to http://localhost:5173 in a browser and you should see the list of instruments.

## Use Supabase with RedwoodJS | Supabase Docs

Use Supabase with RedwoodJS

Learn how to create a Supabase project, add some sample data to your database using Prisma migration and seeds, and query the data from a RedwoodJS app.

Create a new project in the Supabase Dashboard.

Be sure to make note of the Database Password you used as you will need this later to connect to your database.

Open the project Connect panel. This quickstart connects using the Transaction pooler and Session pooler mode. Transaction mode is used for application queries and Session mode is used for running migrations with Prisma.

To do this, set the connection mode to Transaction in the Database Settings page and copy the connection string and append ?pgbouncer=true&&connection_limit=1. pgbouncer=true disables Prisma from generating prepared statements. This is required since our connection pooler does not support prepared statements in transaction mode yet. The connection_limit=1 parameter is only required if you are using Prisma from a serverless environment. This is the Transaction mode connection string.

To get the Session mode connection pooler string, change the port of the connection string from the dashboard to 5432.

You will need the Transaction mode connection string and the Session mode connection string to setup environment variables in Step 5.

You can copy and paste these connection strings from the Supabase Dashboard when needed in later steps.

Create a RedwoodJS app with TypeScript.

The yarn package manager is required to create a RedwoodJS app. You will use it to run RedwoodJS commands later.

While TypeScript is recommended, If you want a JavaScript app, omit the --ts flag.

You'll develop your app, manage database migrations, and run your app in VS Code.

In your .env file, add the following environment variables for your database connection:

The DATABASE_URL should use the Transaction mode connection string you copied in Step 1.

The DIRECT_URL should use the Session mode connection string you copied in Step 1.

*[Content truncated - see full docs]*

**Examples**:

```text
1yarn create redwood-app my-app --ts
```

```text
12cd my-appcode .
```

```text
12345# Transaction mode connection string used for migrationsDATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres.[project-ref]:[db-password]@xxx.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"# Session mode connection string — used by Prisma ClientDIRECT_URL="postgres://postgres.[project-ref]:[db-password]@xxx.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

Use Supabase with refine

Learn how to create a Supabase project, add some sample data to your database, and query the data from a refine app.

Go to database.new and create a new Supabase project.

Alternatively, you can create a project using the Management API:

When your project is up and running, go to the Table Editor, create a new table and insert some data.

Alternatively, you can run the following snippet in your project's SQL Editor. This will create a instruments table with some sample data.

Make the data in your table publicly readable by adding an RLS policy:

Create a refine app using the create refine-app.

The refine-supabase preset adds @refinedev/supabase supplementary package that supports Supabase in a refine app. @refinedev/supabase out-of-the-box includes the Supabase dependency: supabase-js.

You will develop your app, connect to the Supabase backend and run the refine app in VS Code.

Start the app, go to http://localhost:5173 in a browser, and you should be greeted with the refine Welcome page.

You now have to update the supabaseClient with the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY of your Supabase API. The supabaseClient is used in auth provider and data provider methods that allow the refine app to connect to your Supabase backend.

You have to then configure resources and define pages for instruments resource.

Use the following command to automatically add resources and generate code for pages for instruments using refine Inferencer.

This defines pages for list, create, show and edit actions inside the src/pages/instruments/ directory with <HeadlessInferencer /> component.

The <HeadlessInferencer /> component depends on @refinedev/react-table and @refinedev/react-hook-form packages. In order to avoid errors, you should install them as dependencies with npm install @refinedev/react-table @refinedev/react-hook-form.

The <HeadlessInferencer /> is a refine Inferencer component that automatically generates necessary code for the list, create, sh
